# Edge detection for Line-Following-Drone

## 1.  To see the simulation of drone movements in Gazebo: 
   #### run the following command in a terminal: 
        roslaunch px4 mavros_posix_sitl.launch
   #### in another terminal run: 
        python line_follower.py 
                
   **Note** : Make sure you have the installations of gazebo, mavros, and other installations done before running the above terminal commands 
    

**2.** The ***"line_edge_detection.py"*** waits for the user to press a key other than ***'q'*** to move to next frame. This helps to visualize each frame properly. To close the script press 'q'. On pressing 'q', an image ***"defective frame.jpg"*** will be created automatically. So whenever you find that the line does not get detected properly in a frame, you can press 'q', and run the ***"defective.py"*** script to find the suitable parameters for that frame. 

**3.** The ***"play_video.py"*** script also waits for a key to be pressed to move to next frame, ad quits on the press of ***'q'*** key.

# Algorithm

   ![](detected_line.jpg)

   **1.** The Line in the frames, is detected using opencv edge detection.  
   **2.** Then we calculate, how much angle it makes with the vertical, and how far away it is from the center of the frame.  
   **3.** Based on the angle, we first align the drone with the line by adjusting yaw.  
   **4.** Then based on the offset, we align the drone with the center of the frame.  
   **5.** Once Angle, and offset are aligned, we move forward.
